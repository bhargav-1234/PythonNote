#Python String Formating:
'''To make sure a string will display as expected, we can format the result with the format() method.
'''

#String format():
'''The format() method allows you to format selected parts of a string.

Sometimes there are parts of a text that you do not control, maybe they come from a database, or user input?

To control such values, add placeholders (curly brackets {}) in the text, and run the values through the format() method.
'''

   #Add a placeholder where you want to display the price:

price = 49
txt = "The price is {} dollars"
print(txt.format(price))

  #You can add parameters inside the curly brackets to specify how to convert the value:

price = 49
txt = "The price is {:.2f} dollars"
print(txt.format(price))


#Multiple Values:
'''If you want to use more values, just add more values to the format() method.'''
               #print(txt.format(price, itemno, count))

quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49
myorder = "I want {} pieces of item number {} for {:.2f} dollars."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))


#Index Number:
'''You can use index numbers (a number inside the curly brackets {0}) to be sure the values are placed in the correct placeholders:
'''

quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49
myorder = "I want {0} pieces of item number {1} for {2:.2f} dollars."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))
     #Also, if you want to refer to the same value more than once, use the index number:

age = 36
name = "John"
txt = "His name is {1}. {1} is {0} years old."
print(txt.format(age, name))

#Named Indexes:
'''You can also use named indexes by entering a name inside the curly brackets {carname}, 
but then you must use names when you pass the parameter values txt.format(carname = "Ford"):

'''

myorder = "I have a {carname}, it is a {model}."
print(myorder.format(carname = "Ford", model = "Mustang"))
